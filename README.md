# Wanderlust Backend

This is the backend of the Wanderlust app. Wanderlust was developed as part of a class at the [Media University Stuttgart](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/english). Wanderlust is supposed to help backpackers to connect with fellow backpackers and to share their favorite places. It isn't published and this backend isn't deployed anywhere.
